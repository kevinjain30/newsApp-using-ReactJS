    * Integrated camera access using `expo-image-picker`.
    * Automatic geotagging of captured photos with city and precise location data using `expo-location`.

    * Download photos directly to the device's media library using `expo-media-library`.
    * Dismiss (delete) photos from the gallery and local storage.
